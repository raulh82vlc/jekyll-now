# Raúl Hernández López / Raul Hernandez Lopez
*Senior Software Engineer - Android at Twitter & Kotlin lover*

### Overview
I would like to introduce myself as a continuous learner apart from being an experienced Software Engineer (10+ years experience), specialised on the Android platform (8 years) & the Kotlin language (4 years).

Moreover, I am a public speaker when I get the chance for it, so far I've participated like an international speaker in different events: a podcast, meetups or conferences such as Droidcon: UK 2017/19, Spain 2019, EMEA 2020; GOTO Copenhagen 2019; AndroidDevPodcast, Londroid 2017 meetup or Virtual Android Makers 2020 - [presentations slides index](https://speakerdeck.com/raulh82vlc). I write some articles in Medium (linked from this blog too), typically not technical at the end of the year to summarize the past year and technical ones too.

I am from Valencia (Spain) originally, where we use to love paella and horchata, nowadays I am living, working (from home) in London (UK) but I've also lived/worked in Antwerp (Belgium) for almost 1 year and a half.

I do love travelling when I can, listening music metal/rock gigs, reading tech/no-tech books, hanging out with friends, a very cold beer or running sometime.
