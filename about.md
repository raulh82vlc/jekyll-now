# Raúl Hernández López / Raul Hernandez Lopez
*Senior Software Engineer - Android at Twitter & Kotlin lover*

### Overview
I would like to introduce myself as a continuous learner,
apart from being an experienced Software Engineer,
specialised on the Android platform & Kotlin lover, as well as a beginner speaker.

I am from Valencia (Spain), where we use to love paella and horchata,
nowadays I am living, working and enjoying meetups in London (UK)
and conferences
everywhere.

I do love travelling when I can, listening music gigs, reading tech/no-tech books, hanging out with friends, a very cold beer or running.
