title: Look For Events Location AR
---

When studying my *MSc thesis project* at *Cranfield University*,
I was really keen in *Augmented Reality (AR)*.
This is why I proposed this subject in addition to make it on the *Android platform*,
because I really loved the way Android was changing the *mobile* and *smartphones* scenario.

My first training course of *Android development* was at *2011* on my home university in *Spain*,
at *Polytechnic University of Valencia*. Thus, it really enhanced my interest for the platform.

This made me sure, that *Android* would be the right decision for the project and the foreseeable future.

At my original post at *2012* on my previous blog
- Insights and projects on Tumblr, I mentioned the following information:
*MSc Thesis project final screenshots of the validation test.*

The final topic of my MSc thesis project was: **Using Augmented Reality and Geo-location in Android Mobile Devices to Visualise time dependent data**
![Look For Events Location AR]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/field_research_AR_set.png)
As it is shown different events of interest are shown by the Augmented Reality / Geo-location system.

## Overview:
- In the screen there are 3 ongoing events, 1 event that will start in 1 hour at least as well 1 event that will start in more than an hour
- Basically are *color* dependent, where each *color* indicates the proximity in *time* to the current time wherever you are.
- Circles *sizes* indicate the proximity in *distance*.

## Rules:
- *Blue* for events than are far away in time.
- *Green* for events about one hour
- *Yellow* for events that have more than 30 minutes
- *Red* for events really close in time
- *White* for ongoing events.
